#### If your power is down, this scritpt might help...

#### The Main (the top) settings from the full version of the script - 'Tan-Tadi-Taz-TaLa-Script' were added to this version (V.2) of script.
#### I've made it, because I've received a note from one user, who told that with the previous script version there were some glitches:
#### The icons on his desktop start selecting rapidly, when he was using a Security USB flash key. 
#### Also, the script will work with older versions of the installed Autohotkey program more reliably now.
#### Thanks for the hint!

#### This Autohotkey scritpt allows you to copy and paste a way more easier and faster, as well as other operations.
#### The main idea is:
#### You just need to hold a Tab key, never release it, when you are copying anything. 
#### It should  work perfectly for both - for text, and for files, too.
