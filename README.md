# TT-copy-paste Lite Script v.2

## 📌 **About This Version**
*The minimalist approach to maximum efficiency*

**TT copy-paste Lite script** — is a lite version of "autohotkey-copy-paste-tantadtaz" script. 

This version uses minimal keys. Accordingly, there's practically nothing to learn. Except perhaps a simple song, which we'll mention shortly. The beauty of the Lite version is its absolute simplicity — fewer keys, faster mastery, same revolutionary approach.

## 🌙 **Origin Story: From Spilled Juice to Space Technology**
*How an accident led to a revolutionary discovery*

Sometimes great discoveries happen by accident. One day I spilled juice on my keyboard. After extensive cleaning, the bottom left keys — Ctrl, Alt, and Shift — remained sticky. While researching the problem, I learned: these exact keys are always the first to suffer from liquid damage. This mishap pushed me to write code that unexpectedly became a true breakthrough. Now I use it practically all the time.

**Forget about bottom keys forever!** No more Ctrl, Alt, Shift — only the top row of your keyboard: Tab + numbers 1, 2, 4. What's at the bottom — we ignore, what's at the top — we use to the fullest! Especially indispensable in darkness — evening, night, or when you simply can't see the keyboard. Your fingers will always find the large Tab key and the top row of numbers.

Think about it: an astronaut in zero gravity reaches only for the upper, easily accessible keys. Tab+1 — that's the top row, the most obvious place on the keyboard. During smoke conditions on a space station or any emergency situation with limited visibility, the hand intuitively finds the upper keys. Add oxygen deprivation when the brain works poorly? The simple mantra **"Ta-n, Ta-di, Ta-La"** — like a light song, will surface from memory and help copy and transmit critically important information.

## Structure by Groups:

### 🚀 **Quick Start**
*Only 5 keys to remember!*

**In the Lite version, everything is ultra-simple!** You work only with the upper keys of the keyboard. Hold Tab and press just a few keys — everything happens in one zone, under one hand. **The bottom keys Ctrl, Alt, Shift are no longer needed** — forget about them forever.

**The main hotkeys are:**
- **Tab + Top1** — for Copy
- **Tab + Top2** — for Paste
- **Tab + Top4** — for Select All
- **Tab + S** — for Enter
- **Tab + D** — for Enter, too

**That's it! Just 5 combinations for all your daily needs.**

### 💡 **How It Works**
*Simplicity at its finest*

The Lite script uses a revolutionary approach with absolute minimum keys: **all work happens in the upper part of the keyboard**. Tab becomes the only modifier you need. 

**Example workflow (ultra-simple!):**
1. Hold Tab (large key on the left)
2. In Window1: double-click on word → press "1" (copy)
3. Switch to Window2: click where needed → press "2" (paste)
4. Press "S" for new line
5. Repeat — instant productivity!

**Need to select all?** Tab+4 and done!
**Need a new line?** Tab+S or Tab+D — choose what's comfortable!

### 🛡️ **Protection and Control**
*Safety first*

Even in the Lite version, we care about your workflow:

- **ScrollLock** — Suspend Script Toggle
- **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Win+F12** — Emergency Exit

These are the only control keys. ScrollLock is easy to find even in complete darkness, and the emergency exit combination is intentionally complex to avoid accidental activation.

### 🌌 **Universal Application**
*From home to space*

The Lite version with just 5 keys is perfect for:
- **Absolute beginners** — learn in 1 minute, use forever
- **Elderly people** — just 3 numbers to remember (1, 2, 4)
- **Night work** — minimal keys to find in the dark
- **Emergency situations** — when only essentials matter
- **Space missions** — fewer controls mean fewer mistakes

### ⚠️ **Important Notes**
*Quick setup guide*

- **Alt+Tab temporarily unavailable** when script is active (use ScrollLock to suspend)
- Script can be edited in any text editor
- Works with both text and files
- **Learning time:** Literally 1 minute

## 🎭 **Conclusion**

**TT-copy-paste Lite v.2** — is minimalism perfected. Just 5 key combinations replace all the complex keyboard gymnastics. What started as a solution to a spilled keyboard became the simplest productivity tool ever created.

Remember just three numbers: **1 (Copy), 2 (Paste), 4 (Select All)**. Add two letters for Enter (S or D), and you're fully equipped. No more searching for Ctrl, Alt, or Shift in the dark. No more finger stretching. No more mistakes.

The mantra becomes even simpler: **"Ta-n, Ta-di, Ta-La"** — three sounds, infinite possibilities.
