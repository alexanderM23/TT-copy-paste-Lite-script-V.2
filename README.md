If your power is down, this scritpt might help...

The Main (the top) settings from the full version of the script - 'Tan-Tadi-Taz-TaLa-Script' were added to this version (V.2) of script.
I've made it, because I've received a note from one user, who told that with the previous script version there were some glitches:
The icons on his desktop start selecting rapidly, when he was using a Security USB flash key. 
Also, the script will work with older versions of the installed Autohotkey program more reliably now.
Thanks for the hint!

This Autohotkey scritpt allows you to copy and paste a way more easier and faster, as well as other operations.
The main idea is:
You just need to hold a Tab key, never release it, when you are copying anything. 
It is working like this:
If you just press Tab key as usually - the AHK program will send a 'Tab'  Keystroke for the System.
If you press Tab key, and hold it pressed, then press 1 (Top1 key) for example. Then the AHK program will send a 'Ctrl + C'  Keystrokes for the System.
Do not release Tab key, just continue pressing something. - If you press 2 (Top2 key) for example,  the AHK program will send a 'Ctrl + V'  Keystrokes for the System. Because the program was 'understand', that the Tab key, was in 'hold' position. So the AHK program should activate Ctrl key, and to add it to 'V Keystroke' automatically.
And if you press S keyboard key, for example after that, the AHK program will send a Keystroke of 'Enter' key to the System, because it was preprogrammed into the  script before. Even when you are still holding Tab key pressed, the AHK program will make the correct decision - not work as Ctrl Keystroke any more, but do the 'Enter' key.
In another words - you just holding one key of the keyboard, and the program is helping to you to press/to add - more additional  Keystrokes simultaneously. And it is doing it very quick.
And because your fingers are like a bunch - always together, you would be probably less tired of your 'Copy-Paste' operations work, as well.

The 'live' example of how that is working:
First, if you just press Tab, and hold it. 
Then go to Window1. 
Double click on your text's word by Left Mouse button - to select all word. 
Press - 1 key (Top1 key. Continue holding the Tab key).
Go to Window2.
Click just once in that field by Left Mouse button, in place you need to put a word.
Press - 2 key (Top2 key. Continue holding the Tab key).
And you would see the word should appear in Window2.
Press - S key (Continue holding the Tab key), to go to next Line in Window2.
Then return to Window1, and select another word.
- And the speed start to be x2 (x4) for your 'Copy-Paste' process, if you will be training a bit (or you'll get into this a little  bit). 

Note: Alt + Tab keystrokes do not work for switching the Windows (for fast jump from one window to another), if the 'TT copy-paste Lite' script is enabled. You need to suspend it manually, pressing 'End' keyboard key.

I have set the 'End' key - for Suspend toggle.
And you can open the script in any program, like Notepad, and change it for yourself.

It should  work perfectly for both - for text, and for files, too.
Thank you, very much!
